# Applied-Economics

This repository offers scripts to automatically label Twitter and Reddit users by gender and age, using self-reports . Using batches of 200 tweets/posts from their timeline, we train a fastText model to classify <b>other users</b> by gender and age. The distantly supervised model outperforms the baseline and comparable manually annotated data.
